# ThreatIQ – Phishing Awareness Chatbot

## About
**ThreatIQ** is a phishing awareness chatbot that helps users detect suspicious emails or messages.  
It combines heuristic analysis, free threat intelligence sources (VirusTotal, Whois), and generative AI reasoning to:
- Flag phishing indicators (e.g., suspicious links, urgency, poor grammar).
- Explain risks in simple terms.
- Provide safe browsing and handling tips.  
All with a strong focus on **privacy** and **security**.

## Project Goal
The goal of ThreatIQ is to support users in recognizing and understanding phishing attempts.  

**Example Workflow:**
1. User pastes a suspicious email or message.
2. Bot analyzes using heuristics + VirusTotal + Whois.
3. Generative AI explains why it might be phishing.
4. User receives safety tips (e.g., don’t click, report, delete).
